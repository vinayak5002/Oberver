                        </h4>
                        <p>Sweden's central bank Governor Stefan Ingves has said that the regulation of cryptocurrencies like
                            Bitcoin will happen.
                            "When something gets big enough, things like consumer interests and money laundering come into
                            play...So there's good
                            reason to believe that [regulation] will happen," he added. He said the regulation will probably
                            come at different times
                            in different areas.</p>
