                        <p>India has been facing high rates of COVID-19, with more than 27 million confirmed cases since January 2020. Also, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently announced that the B.1.617 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in India is a “variant of global concern.”Some scientists believe that severe COVID-19 could potentially weaken the body’s immune response. This could lead to increased vulnerability to other infections, especially for people who are immunocompromised.

                        <p>Californian officials have announced a $116.5 million pot of vaccine prize money. As the state plans to fully reopen in June, the officials hope that this incentive will entice the 12 million Californians who are eligible for a vaccine but have not yet been vaccinated.
                        Yesterday, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline announced the imminent start of a phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial. The study will involve more than 35,000 adults from the United States, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. If the trial is successful, they expect the vaccine to be available toward the end of 2021.

WHO stated the variants have been named to simplify pronunciation and avoid stigma.</p>
